# Contracts

This feature does not expose network APIs. Contracts cover rendering controls and material bindings:

- Volume uniforms layout (Swift â‡„ Metal) with Int32 flags.
- MPR uniforms and TF binding (`transferColor`).
- Removal of unused `gradient` texture binding.

Contract tests are manual visual validations documented in `quickstart.md`.
